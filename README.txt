This is my personal SFML project.
It started as practice in using SFML library.

The library is fetched during CMake run directly from their git-hub repository.
If you have no Internet, this project will not work.

I built a small library of tools based on SFML such as button, page, etc.
None of these are meant to be professional code; I created these for practicing my C++ skill.

This personal SFML library is then used to implement small game softwares to further practice my C++ coding skill. These games are functional, though currently (2025/03/07), they lack versus A.I. capability.

ADD NOTE 1:
	This project can also be considered as partial practice in using github.
